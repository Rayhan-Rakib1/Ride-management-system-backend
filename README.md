# Ride Booking API

## ✨ Project Overview

A secure, scalable, and role-based backend API for a ride booking system similar to Uber or Pathao. Built with **Express.js** and **Mongoose**, this system supports multiple user roles and implements complete ride lifecycle management.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

* JWT-based login system
* Role-based access control: `admin`, `rider`, `driver`
* Secure password hashing using **bcrypt**

---

## 👥 Roles & Permissions

### Rider

* Request a ride (with pickup & destination)
* Cancel a ride (before acceptance)
* View ride history

### Driver

* Accept/reject ride requests
* Update ride status: `Picked Up → In Transit → Completed`
* View earnings and completed rides
* Set availability: `Online/Offline`

### Admin

* View all users, drivers, and rides
* Approve/suspend drivers
* Block/unblock user accounts

---

## ✨ Features

* Full ride lifecycle: requested → accepted → picked\_up → in\_transit → completed/cancelled
* Location-based data: lat/lng with address
* Driver availability & approval status
* Rider & driver ratings (optional)
* Timestamps logged for all ride status updates

---

## 📂 Tech Stack

* **Node.js** + **Express.js**
* **MongoDB** + **Mongoose**
* **JWT** for auth
* **Zod** for request validation
* **TypeScript**

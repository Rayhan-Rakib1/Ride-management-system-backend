# üöñ Ride Booking API

## ‚ú® Project Overview
A secure, scalable, and role-based backend API for a ride booking system inspired by **Uber** or **Pathao**. Built with **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **TypeScript**, this system supports multiple user roles (Rider, Driver, Admin, SuperAdmin) and manages the complete ride lifecycle, including authentication, OTP verification, payments, and ride history.

---

## üîê Authentication
- JWT-based authentication: Secure login with access and refresh tokens.  
- Google OAuth: Social login for seamless user onboarding.  
- OTP Verification: Two-factor authentication via email or SMS.  
- Role-based access control: Permissions for Rider, Driver, Admin, and SuperAdmin.  
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt.

---

## üë• Roles & Permissions

### Rider
- Register and manage profile  
- Request, cancel, and view ride history  
- Make payments for rides  
- Rate drivers after ride completion  

### Driver
- Register and manage availability (online/offline)  
- Accept/reject ride requests  
- Update ride status (picked_up ‚Üí in_transit ‚Üí completed)  
- View ride history and earnings  
- Rate riders after ride completion  

### Admin / SuperAdmin
- View and manage all users, drivers, and rides  
- Approve or suspend drivers  
- Block/unblock user accounts  
- Access payment details  

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Full Ride Lifecycle: `requested ‚Üí accepted ‚Üí picked_up ‚Üí in_transit ‚Üí completed/cancelled`  
- Location-based data: Pickup and destination with latitude/longitude and addresses  
- Driver management: Approval status and availability toggling  
- Ratings: Optional rider and driver ratings post-ride  
- Payment integration: Initialize, validate, and handle payment success/failure/cancellation  
- OTP Verification: Secure user authentication with one-time passwords  
- Timestamps: Logged for ride status updates and history tracking
